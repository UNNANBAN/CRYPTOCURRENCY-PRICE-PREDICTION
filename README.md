# CRYPTOCURRENCY-PRICE-PREDICTION
Developed a Cryptocurrency Price Prediction System using LSTM, XGBoost and GBR models. Trained LSTM and XGBoost as base Model and GBR as Ensemble Stacking Model.


Program execution Methodology:
  1. Executing the "Collecting the Historical Data.py" file will fetch our dataset as "bitcoin_price_data.csv".
  2. Now executing "bitcoin price price prediction.py" will develop LSTM and XGBoost base models and the results of these models will further processed using an Ensemble Stacking model GBR.
  3. The output includes visualisation and evaluation of each models and Predicted price for the next day.
